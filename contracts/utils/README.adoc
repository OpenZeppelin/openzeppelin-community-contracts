Miscellaneous contracts and libraries containing utility functions you can use to improve security, work with new data types, or safely use low-level primitives.

 * {Masks}: Library to handle `bytes32` masks.
 * {ERC7739Utils}: Utilities library that implements a defensive rehashing mechanism to prevent replayability of smart contract signatures based on ERC-7739.
 * {ERC7739Signer}: An abstract contract to validate signatures following the rehashing scheme from `ERC7739Utils`.
