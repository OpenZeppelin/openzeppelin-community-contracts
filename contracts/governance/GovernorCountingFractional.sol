 * @notice Extension of {Governor} for 3 option fractional vote counting. When voting, a delegate may split their vote
 * weight between Against/For/Abstain. This is most useful when the delegate is itself a contract, implementing its
 * own rules for voting. By allowing a contract-delegate to split its vote weight, the voting preferences of many
 * disparate token holders can be rolled up into a single vote to the Governor itself. Some example use cases include
 * voting with tokens that are held by a DeFi pool, voting from L2 with tokens held by a bridge, or voting privately
 * from a shielded pool using zero knowledge proofs.
